## Openness:
One of the agile core values, Openness as stated in Manifesto "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" is valuing people over processes or tools. 
* Being open about our work helps create transparency to our progress.
* Openness enables team members to ask for help and offer help.
* Openness enables team members to share their perspectives, feel heard by their peers, and be able to support team decisions.
* When our assumptions turn out to be invalid, openness helps us admit we were wrong and change direction. 

* As a part of a diverse team, I adapted these qualities, which helped to proceed ahead with the project in an organised way.
