## Commitment

To keep things simple and in managed way, a team should be enthusiastic and should set commitments to complete the job.


## Important aspect of Commitment

1. Visualize your commitments - use Kanban or different boards for visualizing tasks
2. Limit “Work in Progress” - Commit to your small portion of work
3. Say “no” - prioritize your work and commit only if possible
4. Distinguish between commitments and predictions
5. Use historical data probability
6. Incorporate “stretch” stories
7. Renegotiate as necessary - Be clear if somthing is missing out and try to communicate for renogetiations
